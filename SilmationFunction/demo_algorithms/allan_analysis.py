'''
The algorithm should be a Python class with three memeber functions.
1. __init__: config the interface of the algorithm.
    input: a tuple or list of variables this algorithm requires;
           There are two kinds of variables: constant through different calls of this algorithm and
           varying through different calls of this algorithm.
           These variables are defined in imu_sim.py as self.supported_in_constant and
           self.supported_in_varying. Users should check the two variables for input that
           imu_sim.py can provide to your algorithms.
    output: a tuple or list of variables this algorithm returns;
            The algorithm outpu that can be understood by the imu_sim.py is defined in imu_sim.py as
            self.supported_out. All algorithm outputs are assumed varying through different calls of
            the algorithm.
    batch: This defines in which way the "run" method of the algorithm should be called.
           If True, input variables sampled at all times should be provided to the algorithm;
           If False, input variables should be provided to the algorithm sample by sample.
           Only "batch is True" is supported for now
2. run: run the algorithm.
    set_of_input: a tuple or list of input variables consistent with self.input.
3. get_results: return results of the algorithm.
    self.resultsï¼š a tuple or list of results consistent with self.output.
